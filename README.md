Self-Reflection: Work with datasets

  Assignment: Step 3: Explore more datasets

      From the Kaggle homepage, select Datasets to view the available datasets.

      Select a category that interests you or that aligns with your career goals. Select Download to download the data and begin analyzing it. Based on the dataset you chose, create a list of 3-5 SMART questions, develop a completed SOW, and create a new Google Sheet with performed analytics that best align to your dataset.	
      
Chosen Dataset: Global Electric Vehicle Sales Data (2010-2024)

SMART Questions Based on the Dataset: 

• Of the data available, which parts are most interesting to you?
• What country or countries do you want to focus on? What range of years?
• Which powertrain sold the most in Canada over the past year? over the past 3-5 years?
• How many EVs were sold in general in Canada over the past 3-5 years? Which years performed the best (sold the most)? Of those years, which powertrain had the highest sales?
• How has public availability of charging points changed (increased/decreased) over the years? How does this correlate to available stock of EVs over the years?
• Which type of vehicle has the most EVs available? Of those, which powertrain is most popular/available?
• What factors contribute to increased EV use in a given population’s environment? (ie. urban vs rural, cultural norms, media, education, etc)

Scope-Of-Work:

Canada EV Data 2024
 Data Analysis Project
                                                                                        
Data Analyst: Olivia Catroppa
Client/Sponsor: N/A

 Purpose: 
Write a brief description of why this project is happening below. Why is this project happening? What are the goals?

The purpose of this project is to discover patterns in how sales of EVs have changed in Canada over the last 12 years and determine which EV type (mode and powertrain) is the most preferable to Canadians in 2024. 

 Scope / Major Project Activities:
What are the major parts of this project? List out the high-level steps, activities, or stages of the project, and give a brief description for each. 

Activity | Description
Data Cleaning | Original dataset is mined and refined to only include relevant data
Data Analysis | Insights uncovered within data via various forms of spreadsheet analysis (formulas)
Drawing Conclusions | Once data is refined and collected in the analysis, results can be observed and conclusions drawn in order to address the original problem in question. 
Generating Visuals | Create charts and graphs to further communicate drawn conclusions.
Deliver Report | PDF report of written analysis along with visualizations to be presented.

 This project does not include:
Specify the things that this project isn’t responsible for doing (out of scope). For instance, “this project does not involve a summation of 2019 data analysis”

• Project does not include a Cost Analysis of EVs
• Does not include data from the current year (2024)
• Analysis is on an overall Federal level, not local, municipal, provincial, etc. 

 Deliverables:
A specific list of things that your project will deliver.   

Deliverable | Description/ Details
Written Report with Visualizations | Clearly detailed written report accompanying visual representations of data in the form of a PDF.
Refined Spreadsheet Data | Copy of cleaned, filtered, and visually pleasing dataset on which the report is based.

 Schedule Overview / Major Milestones:
The expected schedule for the project. This can be defined by milestones (e.g. “all data is cleaned and processed”), periods of time (“Week 1 / Week 2”), or other ways based on the needs of the project. 

Milestone | Expected Completion Date | Description/Details
Data is Ready to Use | Day 1 | Data has been cleaned and refined to pertinent use, ready for analysis
Analysis Completion | Day 1 | Data has been analyzed in order to answer initial problem, insights revealed
Analysis Refinement | Day 2 | Analysis results are further cleaned up and synthesized into communicable results
Visualizations and Report | Days 2-3 | Appropriate charts and graphs are generated to communicate results, along with written insights accompanied in the Report
Present Report | Day 4 | Final report delivered

 *Estimated date for completion: 
This is my “if all goes well and I have everything I need, this is when I’ll be done” date. 

Tasks to be completed within a 4-day timeframe.
